Data preparation:

1) rename the files with numbers (like lre-eng-0000.wav, use - instead of _), dont use abhabetical file name (like lre-aaaa.wav) it will create problem in sorting.
(the matlab code for file renaming: data_rename.m, database structure required: language_label/filename.wav)
2) use lre_exp.sh and lre_exp_test.sh to perform datapreparation for kaldi. (need to run 3 time lre_exp_test.sh for 3 sec, 10 sec and 10 sec by changing the datapath, in my case the name of test language label folder is different from train so I use sed command in line 9 of lre_exp_test.sh file, if your case it is same please comment the line.)
3) After the data preparation is over you can run run.sh file.
4) Follow the comments in run.sh file
5) Data require: Muscan and rir (downloaded from https://openslr.org/17/, please give the proper folder location in run.sh) and language train data. all train data should be in 16 bit, else convert it using sox.
6) Python3 is required.
7) prepare the labels for final evaluation using lre_custom_test_list_generator.m file.
8) from the exp/score folder you can get the result.
